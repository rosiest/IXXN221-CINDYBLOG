				Hi! My name’s Cindy and I’m currently a second-year Design student at Victoria University, majoring in Media Design & Fashion Design. 
				I’m 19 years old and I’m from Blenheim, New Zealand. However, a fun fact about me is that I used to live in Perth, Australia for 6 years, 
				so my accent is literally a mix of Kiwi and Australian. I’ve always been interested in coding, especially from Creative Coding. From this, 
				I know JavaScript! In this course, I’d like to learn basic website coding as well as the basic design elements. I think it would be interesting
				to learn this from an interaction design perspective, as I’m not familiar with anything related to the field.

						As the first tutorial of the IXXN221 course, we were introduced to the basic set up and what we will be initially 
						learning for the trimester. In class, we had a brief introduction to HTML and the ways we can style it. Essentially, 
						we were given a micro-assignment, which was to analyse the HTML and CSS of an existing website and to emulate any 
						element from the chosen website into our own. I chose to analyse a website called
						<a href="https://crybaby.com/l">"CryBaby"</a>
						which is a clothing store in America.

					<p class="blog-details">
						In class, we learnt how to use classes to target particular elements within our HTML and how to import an external
						CSS stylesheet. Developing from the last tutorial, I copied some of the basic elements on the homepage, such as
						the navigation bar + logo and the site’s images. As this was my first time with HTML and CSS, I was unsure how
						to do some things such as changing fonts or proper sizing. However, I was able to get a gist of the layout of the
						code and how it works.

					<p class="blog-details">
						For this week’s tutorial, we were introduced to our course blog, which will be done throughout the whole trimester. 
						This session, I did a basic set up for the blog such as creating the files and creating a repository on GitHub. 
						Using Figma for the first time, I set up some basic wireframes for the blog. I planned to follow a basic layout 
						from my own blog from Tumblr. Some elements I used were a navigation bar at the bottom and rounded corners for blog posts.

					<p class="blog-details">
						In tutorial four, we went through some common and helpful CSS tools which I personally found very useful as I initially
						had little to no knowledge about CSS. The learning progress included a tutorial on positioning in CSS which was what I
						needed help with mainly from the website exercise I did earlier. I had a look at CSS layout from
						<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp">w3schools</a>
						and played around with this for a bit. I was also able to clean 
						up my code a bit and delete anything unnecessary. Essentially, we were introduced to assignment one. After looking at
						the brief, I’m probably going to do the Victoria University Degree Planner assignment as it looks more appealing to me.

						In this tutorial, we went over Figma as some of us, such as myself, were unfamiliar with the program. We went over flex
						box and media queries. Some helpful resources I looked at were 
						<a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">css-tricks</a>
						and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp">w3schools.</a>
						I also had a look at the code challenge on GitHub and

					<p class="blog-details">
						For this class, we had a brief lecture on responsive web design. I found this very useful as we had a look at common web design
						patterns and basically learnt what were good design options and what weren’t. I did some further research on my own and had a look 
						at <a href="http://ui-patterns.com/">UI Patterns,</a>
						where I basically learnt persuasive design patterns such as cognition (patterns of psychological 
						tendencies that cause the human brain to draw incorrect conclusions) and perception and memory.

					<p class="blog-details">
						For this class, we had a brief lecture to discuss the best practices for Assignment One. I had some trouble starting the assignment 
						and I was able to get assistance for this, such as tips for what to include in my assignment. One important tip I received was to keep 
						notations, as this will be needed for later on in the assignment. We also learn what tools and languages are relevant when wanting to convey 
						the UX of a website concept and design. I also learnt about user stories, which was something incredibly new to me. A user story is an informal, 
						general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. I got this information from 
						<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories ">Atlassian.</a>
						After the lecture, I continued to work on assignment one and went over the brief once again.

						In this tutorial, we were introduced to JavaScript. I sort of had prior knowledge to JavaScript from both Creative Coding courses so 
						I was very aware on most of the things talked about in the lecture. JavaScript is a fundamental of web development and in short, allows 
						for interactivity and changeability of our interfaces. Furthermore, we covered the various concepts with emphasis on both variables and 
						functions, the main points of JavaScript. I did further research and looked into website that showed JavaScript basics such as 
						<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp">w3schools.</a>

					<p class="blog-details">
						This lesson we had a recap of all the content we have covered so far and an initial plan of what the next few weeks will involve. 
						Once again, we went through wireframes, HTML, CSS (Flexbox, grid, layout and positioning) and JavaScript. We were also put into our 
						groups for the final project of the course and this was the first time I had communicated with mine via Discord. Beforehand, we were 
						all supposed to come up pitch ideas for a website we were all going to develop. My group was Jack, Jamie, Madisyn, Kat and I. We decided 
						to go forward with Madisyn’s idea of a “phonebook” concept, where we’d have a website that displayed curated businesses. We spent this 
						session discussing ideas for a concept and considering things such as what types of businesses the website would involve, etc. We started 
						up a shared document to get started with the project.

					<p class="blog-details">
						Developing further from the shared document, we organised our plan and project more. We discussed possible routes for navigation of 
						content and experiences for the site. This changed drastically and involved a lot of discussion but we were able to agree on a few things. 
						We set up the Figma and Jamie and Kat drew up a User Flow Diagram. The rest of started looking into style inspiration and made a Pinterest 
						board. All this relevant information can be built to develop mood boards and style guide.

					<p class="blog-details">
						For this tutorial, we learnt the differences between block frames, wireframes and prototypes for our group project. We’d have to include 
						all of these in our Figma and I was super grateful for this lecture because I initially I had thought that block frames and wireframes 
						were the same. We learnt about why these things help us communicate to our client and potential users, as well as aiding us in the process 
						of designing and building a website. As group, we started building our block frames. We decided to do this by allocating a page each and we 
						were to build a block frame for the page. My page was the ‘Nominations’ page, where I created two block frames. Furthermore, we started building 
						up a style guide which includes our colour scheme.

					<p class="blog-details">
						This lesson, we were given a lecture on style systems and their importance in efficient and consistent designing and building of a website. 
						As a group, we came together and reviewed each block frames. Doing the block frames separately sort of helped the project, however, Jamie 
						created a more accurate design of block frames that showed navigation and the concept of having the website as “one whole page”. He also 
						prototyped the block frames to show us his idea and it gave us a clear grasp of the idea. From these block frames, we were able to have more 
						of an understanding and outlook of what we want the website to look like and function as.

					<p class="blog-details">
						In this tutorial, we went over proper prototyping and the different methods and trends involved. We were given a tutorial on how 
						to do prototyping on Figma such as how to do it as a mobile view as well. We also covered the importance of prototyping in 
						experimenting and testing ideas with end users. In my group, we planned to get the prototyping done so that we could perform user 
						testing ASAP. We used our wireframes as a basis for building the prototype. We also decided to meet up in our time to work on the prototypes.

					<p class="blog-details">
						Further developing our prototypes involved a lot of discussion in between the group. This process is very important as our prototype 
						is supposed to look identical to our finished website. We tried to follow the style guide but our decisions kept changing drastically 
						so we decided to leave the finalised version of the style guide to the end. We also added some interactive elements for the prototypes 
						to work for the user testing.

						This lesson, we began with a lecture on the important of user testing, different techniques and approaches we could use and how important 
						it is in the process of design and development of web applications. Following the lecture, we got back into our groups and discussed how we 
						were going to perform the user testing. We decided to have a set of questions that suit the prototype experience and we’d each perform user 
						testing on one person. We would then display our results on the shared google document. We tried to aim to test a user that has no prior knowledge 
						of the project so our results were as accurate and clean as possible.

						This lesson included each group going through their prototypes in front of the class and presented the project at its current state. 
						We received very useful feedback from other groups and as well as the staff. We took many things into consideration and the feedback involved input 
						that we probably wouldn’t of ever considered. User testing and feedback is very important as usually when you’re working on a project, you’re so 
						involved that it’s difficult to tell what needs work and what doesn’t. After receiving all the feedback, we went back on our prototypes and made some 
						changes and tweaks.

						This tutorial involved a lecture on Agile frameworks. “Agile frameworks are not only relevant because they are widely used in web design and

						through identifying exactly what it is that we are trying to develop, design, build and achieve.” After this, we went forward with starting up the

						Overall, the content and experience of this course were not only challenging but very insightful. Through the different projects, 
						I was able to get a gist into Interaction Design, website design and the overall elements within the design. I think this was quite 
						useful for me because we learnt basic principles of design as well, rather than just learning straight-up code. The group project 
						assisted me with the cooperation and I was able to experience the work that would most definitely be included further from university 
						in workspaces. I enjoyed this course and will most likely take next year’s course developing from this if it’s available!
